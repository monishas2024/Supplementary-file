To run this code, a Python interpreter needs to be installed on the system. Additionally, consider using a development environment called PyCharm.
The following are the steps to set up the environment:
Step 1. Python installation:
Download and install Python from the official Python website.
Ensure to add Python to the system's PATH during the installation process.
Step 2. Library installation:
Pseudocode uses libraries such as NumPy, which are commonly used for numerical calculations in Python.
Install these libraries in the terminal or command prompt using the following command:
pip install numpy
Step 3. Development environment (optional):
Choose a development environment that you are familiar with, PyCharm.
Step 4. Hardware requirements:
No high-performance hardware is required. It should be able to run on standard hardware configurations. However, actual performance will depend on the scale and complexity of the optimization problem.
Step 5. Operating system:
The code is cross-platform and can run on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
Step 6. Execution:
Copy the pseudocode into a Python file (using the. py extension).
Run Python files using a Python interpreter.
The following is an example command to run a Python script from the command line:
python script. py
